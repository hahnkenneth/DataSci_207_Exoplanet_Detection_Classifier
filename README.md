The data (labelled as cumulative.csv) was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results) and we used this as a way to develop a binary classifier for exoplanet detection. The final presentation is also attached as a pdf along with a more indepth document explanation on my [portfolio site](https://hahnkenneth.github.io/projects/7_project/).
